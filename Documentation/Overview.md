Objectives:
- Provide accessible, non-clinical guidance via an AI chatbot.
- Offer robust mood tracking and visualization to promote self-awareness.
- Facilitate supportive, moderated communities for peer-to-peer interaction.
- Enable summarization and safe handling of hospital and medical records.

Target audience: Undergraduate project reviewers, academic evaluators, and stakeholders interested in digital mental health tools.

Design principles:
- Privacy-first: minimal personally-identifying telemetry and opt-in behaviors.
- Accessibility: color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen-reader friendliness as core priorities.
- Extensibility: modular frontend and backend layers for future research and integration.

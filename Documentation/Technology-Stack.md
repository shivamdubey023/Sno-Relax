# Technology Stack

This file summarizes technologies used and rationale for inclusion.

## Frontend
- React (Create React App) — component-based UI for the client and admin.
- Tailwind CSS / Custom CSS — responsive utility classes and custom theme variables.
- Chart.js — for mood visualization and analytics.

## Backend
- Node.js & Express — RESTful API and server-side logic.
- Socket.IO — real-time messaging and notifications.
- Axios / fetch — client-server communication on the frontend.

## Database
- MongoDB (Mongoose) — document store for user data, moods, messages, and settings.

## AI / Logic Layer
- Cohere (cloud NLP) — conversational responses and report summarization.
- Python scripts — training and data pre-processing tools (for experiment tracking and reproducible results).

## Tools & Environment
- Git & GitHub — version control and submission.
- Jest / React Testing Library — unit and integration tests.
- ESLint / Prettier — code quality and formatting.

Rationale: The chosen stack balances research flexibility (AI experiments) with deployability and accessibility for an undergraduate capstone submission.
